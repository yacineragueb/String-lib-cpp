# 📚 String Library in C++

## ✨ Description: 
This project demonstrates a custom C++ class `clsString` that provides advanced string manipulation features beyond the standard library using object oriented programming.

This project is perfect for learning **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in C++ and for building reusable libraries.

## 🛠️ Requirements: 
- A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)

---

## 💻 Example Usage:
```cpp
clsString str("hi how are you?");
cout << "Words Count: " << str.CountWords() << endl; // Output: 4

str.UpperFirstLetterOfEachWord();
cout << str.Value << endl; // Output: Hi How Are You?

str.InvertAllLettersCase();
cout << str.Value << endl; // Output: hI hOW aRE yOU?
```
